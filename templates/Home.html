<!-- ------------------- -->
<p>Cardiovascular disease is a general term that describes a disease of the heart or blood vessels.</br>

Blood flow to the heart, brain or body can be reduced because of a:</br>
<center>
<ol><li>Blood clot (thrombosis).</li> 
<li>Build-up of fatty deposits inside an artery, leading to the artery hardening and narrowing (atherosclerosis).</li></ol>
</center>
</p>
</br>

<p><b>Types of Cardiovascular Disease</b></br>
There are four main types of CVD:</br>
<center>
<ol>
<li>Coronary heart disease</li> 
<li>Stroke</li> 
<li>Peripheral arterial disease</li>
<li>Aortic disease</li>
</ol>
</center>
</p>
</br>
<p><b>Coronary heart disease</b></br>
Coronary heart disease (CHD) occurs when your heart muscle's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances (atheroma) in the coronary arteries.</br>
If it becomes completely blocked, it can cause a heart attack.</br>
State: This is a medical emergency.</p></br>

<p><b>Stroke</b></br>
A stroke is a serious medical condition that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is disturbed.</br>
State: Stroke is a medical emergency and prompt treatment is essential.</p></br>

<p><b>Peripheral arterial disease</b></br>
Peripheral arterial disease, also known as peripheral vascular disease, occurs when there is a blockage in the arteries to your limbs (in legs).</br>
State: The pain as cramp, a dull pain or a sensation of heaviness in the muscles of your legs.</p>

<p>Aortic disease</br>
The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. It carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body.</br>
State: The wall of the aorta becomes weakened and bulges outwards as pain in your chest, back or abdomen.</p></br>


<p><b>Risk factors of cardiovascular disease:</b>
The Risk factors of cardiovascular disease are:</br>
<ol>
<li>High blood pressure (hypertension)</li>
<li>Smoking (or other tobacco use)</li>
<li>High blood cholesterol</li> 
<li>Diabetes</li> 
<li>Poor diet</li>
<li>Lack of exercise</li> 
<li>Being overweight</li>
<li>Excessive alcohol consumption</li>
<li>Stress</li>
<li>Family history</li>
<li>Ethnicity</li>
</ol></p>

<p><b>Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease:</b></br>
Most deaths caused by cardiovascular disease are premature.</br>
It can easily be prevented by making lifestyle changes
 <ol><li> eating a healthy diet
 <li> stopping smoking.</li></ol></br>
It is estimated that CVD is responsible for around 1 in 3 premature deaths in men and 1 in 5 premature deaths in women.</p>

  <h2 class="w3-wide">Heart Disease Prediction</h2>
  <p class="w3-justify">
  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Around 1 in 4 deathsTrusted Source in the U.S. occur due to heart disease, and the condition affects all genders as well as all racial and ethnic groups.

In this article, learn more about the types, causes, and symptoms of heart disease. This article also covers risk factors and treatment.
  </p>
<h2>Types</h2>
<p>Heart disease refers to any condition affecting the cardiovascular system. There are several different types of heart disease, and they affect the heart and blood vessels in different ways.

The sections below look at some different types of heart disease in more detail.
</P>
<h2>Coronary artery disease</h2>
<p>
Coronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is the most common type of heart disease.

It develops when the arteries that supply blood to the heart become clogged with plaque. This causes them to harden and narrow. Plaque contains cholesterol and other substances.

As a result, the blood supply reduces, and the heart receives less oxygen and fewer nutrients. In time, the heart muscle weakens, and there is a risk of heart failure and arrhythmias.

When plaque builds up in the arteries, it is called atherosclerosis. Plaque in the arteries can rupture from blockages and cause blood flow to stop, which can lead to a heart attack.
</p>
<h2>Congenital heart defects</h2>
<p>A person with a congenital heart defect is born with a heart problem.</p>
